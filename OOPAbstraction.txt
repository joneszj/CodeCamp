Abstraction is the skill of describing real life or conceptual objects as if they were classes and object in code

Think of a chair: it has legs, a weight limit, a back piece and other properties and methods available to it.

A human has height, weight, limbs

Methods describe what something does
A human can run, talk, walk, think
