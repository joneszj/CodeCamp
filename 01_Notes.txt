That is my personal contact info. Please don't share it
However, if at anytime you need assistance understanding something or stepping through code, don't hesitate to contact me
I really don't care how you decide to contact me, just don't be afraid to when you need to
I am generally up until 12-2am writing these silly courses
Also,  goo... I mean Bing (lol) and youtube are amazing resourses, use them!
I seriously enjoy teaching in general

For Mac users, please follow this tutorial for our console applications
http://michaelcrump.net/creating-and-debugging-console-apps-with-vscode/

*****Setup
Create a new solution with a console application project
Name the solution CodeCamp, name the project: 01_HelloWorld

*****Notes
We can use Console.WriteLine(""); to print information to the console application
cw tab tab for shortcut
practice using cw
Congratz on your first C# application!

Examine the project:
Solutions, Projects, Solution Explorer, Directives
Solutions contain (primarialy) projects that contain code, and configuration files
Directives (using System;) allow use to easily import namespaces from other projects
(we are getting Console from the system.console class)
Namespace - all code must be in a namespace. The namespace prevents name collision, and is used to group related objects
Class Program - all code must also be in a class. For now that is all we need to know
Main method -  the Console app looks for a class called Program and a method called Main in that class as an entry point
the application to run

Console is a class with methods to assist in using console applications
Console.Writeline is one of those methods that will write something to the console application

*****Assignment
Write five or more statements to the console with the last statement being “Hello World”
Prevent the console from immediately closing when reaching the end of your code
Hint: console.readkey()

*****VS Tips
ctrl c, ctrl p (highlight or line copy)
ctrl k + ctrl d (auto format document)

*****Side
all this may seem very foreign to you, but fear not, it won't be for long!
