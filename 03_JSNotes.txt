*****Setup
create a new console application: 03_JSUseStrict

the use strict declaration will help us in that it will cause an error where in 
non strict mode JS will often help by assuming what you were trying to do.

x = 3.14; will error out as we did not use the var. 
Non strict mode would create a new var automatically... This could be problematic at times

//var x = 3.14;
//delete x;                // This will cause an error, delete is not permitted in strict mode

*****Assignment
implement the use strict declaration
attempt to assign a variable without the var keyword (hoisting)

*****Goal
Understand what use strict does and how it can be useful or not
