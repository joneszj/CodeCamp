C# has the concept of Value vs Reference types
http://www.albahari.com/valuevsreftypes.aspx

value types pass the under laying value obect(s) when capied or consumed by methods
reference types pass a reference (like a pointer) to the object being copied or being consumed by a method

classes are reference types
structs are value types

note: I have never encountered the need to use a struct
