Creating class operators is another thing I have never done, nor needed to do, nor have I actually seen in anyone elses code

in my opinion, overloaded operators are a means of implementing syntactic sugar...

overloadable operators: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8edha89s(VS.71).aspx

All custom operator implementations follow a certain pattern. They look like static
methods, but in the place where you’d normally expect the method name, you instead
have the  operator keyword followed by the operator for which you want to define a
custom meaning. This is followed by a parameter list, and the number of parameters is
determined by the number of operands the operator requires.



However, if you come accross operators in other languages that you would like implemented in C# you can 
use overloaded operators to implement it
