Abstraction
Reference vs Value Types
Classes (reference types)
Structs (value types)
Members: fields (including const, readonly keywords), constructors (default, parameterized, chaining, static), 
	methods (static, out, ref, overloading, extension methods), 
	properties (value keyword and auto-properties), indexers, operators, events, nested types
Interfaces
Enums
Partial Classes and Methods
Encapsulation: access modifiers (private, public, internal)
Inheritance
Generics
Delegates & Events

Required locations for the this keyword: constructor chaining, extension methods, class indexers
