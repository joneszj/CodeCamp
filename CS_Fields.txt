We should already have a good understanding of fields. Field represent what a class 'has'. 

Fields are intended to be hidden (private) from everything but the class they belong to.

We expose fields via methods or properties

Fields generally start with an underscore by convention

Fields have a type, a name, and a value

{type} {name} = {value};
int _height = 58;

readonly - C# readonly tells the code that this value can only be set at instantiation time (this can be worked around, but for now 
we can leave it there)
const - the const is like readonly only it can never change.
