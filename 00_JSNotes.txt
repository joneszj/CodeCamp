I have the playground project open as a reference to the readline module from node

initially, the console application only outputs information in node. We can bring in the readline module
to enable us to get user information and do stuff with it

I am taking an unorthodox approach to teaching javascript. usually it would be taught in the web browser
but I want us to understand that javascript is an actually language, not just some sort of api 
for manipulating the browser.

Once we understand this, we will start working on using js in the dom and bom

But don't think of js as simply a tool for dom bom manipulation! Js can be used in applications and even
microprocessors!https://tessel.io/

*****(wiki)JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based, such as PDF documents
, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) 
and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web applications. 
On the client side, JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, 
but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation. It is also used in game development, 
the creation of desktop and mobile applications, and server-side network programming with 
runtime environments such as Node.js.

With that said, lets start with the fundamentals of javascript!
