*****Setup
Create a new Console Application: 05_IfElse

*****If Else
if else statments allow us to execute code depending on if the if else condition returns true, or false
if else statements create code blocks (scope)
we can use expressions or variables for if else statement condistions
if else statements are also called conditional statments

*****Assignment
using booleans true and false, print to the console a statement

*****Comparison/Equality Operators
== ! != > < >= <=
using an equality operator will return a boolean between two or more operands

*****Logical Operators
& && | ||
and SC-and or SC-or

*****else if
we can list if statements (similar to a switch) and each will execute if their respective conditions are met
often times this is not desireable. We can use else if statements. Else if statments will only execute if the original
if statement fails, and once the if else statement executes, no other if statements will execute

*****Assignment - Scenario: age requirement for drivers license
use conditional statements inconjunction with equality comparisons
prompt the user for a value, compare it, do something from the comparison
mix in tryparse

*****Extra - Short Circuiting

*****Homework

Create a simple elementary math quiz
if the user submits a correct answer, respond congradulating them
if the user submits an incorrect answer, respont that the answer is incorrect
5-10 questions is sufficient
Use each of the equality operators

*****VS Tip
if tab tab will generate an if statement quickly for us
