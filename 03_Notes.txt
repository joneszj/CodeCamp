*****Setup
Create a new console project: 03_CastsAndConversions

*****Casts
You likely experienced some frustration attempting to assign decimal values to integers, or even
decimal values to floats
Casting will attempt to convert a value to another
({cast to type}){cast from variable}
Casting will truncate information it cannot cast (ex. casting to an int will truncate decimal values of a double)

*****Assignment
Create and initialize a few floating point types
create new integer variables from casting the previous variables
print the new variables to the console

*****Converts
Converts are found in the System.Convert class
Conversions will attempt to round to its nearest equivalent converted type
System.Convert({variable to convert})

*****Assignment
Using the same variables floating point variables created at the start
create new variables and assign them using the convert functions
