*****Setup
create a console application: 04_JSLooselyTyped

*****LooselyTyped
JS is a loosely (or untyped) typed language. 
Which means variable types are guessed by the language. 
This can be problematic at times

Types in JS are dynamic. Meaning they type can change at any time
the dynamic keyword in C# is a little differnt but we will cover that in OOP for C#

JS will also attempt to resolve operands if the types do not match
for example, adding a number to a string number

*****Assignment
create some variables as numbers and or strings
cl those variables
reassign the variable with a new type
cl the new variables

*****Side
var x;               // Now x is undefined
x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
x = "John";      // Now x is a String

7 + 7 + 7; // = 21  
7 + 7 + "7"; // = 147  
"7" + 7 + 7; // = 777 

*****Goal
Understand the difference between strongly typed and loosely typed programming languages
