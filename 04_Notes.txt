*****Setup
Create a new console application: 04_ParseTryParse

*****Parse
parse and tryparse are on the types you want to parse as
(ex int.parse, int.tryparse(inVariable, out outVariable))
Casting and converting are useful if we can expect the to execute variable to already be a number type
Parse and TryParse are useful when converting strings to numbers

The Console.ReadLine() returns a string of user input when hitting enter

*****Assignment
cw a few questions asking for a number
using the readline method, assign a string for each questions asked
use the parse method to capture and parse to int the string
pass a non-number value (will error)

*****TryParse
TryParse allows us to attempt to parse a string, if success: out the parsed value, else: do something else
tryparse will itself return boolean true or false depending on success
TryParse is generally the most safe method as it will not error the application if it fails to parse
The TryParse method requires and out parameter that it will pass the parsed value to

*****Assignment
cw a few questions asking for a number, or boolean
use the tryparse to parse the returned string
