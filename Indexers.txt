Indexers are useful for classes that have collections (we will go into more depth on collecitons [generics] later)

Indexers allow us to traverse a class similarly in the way we can use an indexer to traverse an array

I haven't really ever create a class indexer so I will leave this with the demo as it is somewhat
self explanitory if you are at the level that you should know how to create your own indexer
