*****Setup
Create a new console application: 07_WhileDoWhile

*****While
While loops will execute code over and over as long as a condition is not met
While loops may never execute if the condition is not met

*****DoWhile
Exactly the same as while loops except Do While loops will always execute atleast once
DoWhile loops are useful to keeps our console repeating without closing!

*****Random Class
To demonstrate the while and do while loops I will introduce the Random class
The Random class is useful for generating random numbers
The random class must be instantiated and the next method called for a rendom number

*****Assignment - Scenario: Random Number Guessing Game
using the random class, generate a random number
use a char variable to indicate application close (use x)
use a do while loop to prompt the user to guess the random number
if the user guesses correctly, exit the do while loop and let them know
then as the user if they would like to close or repeat
if the user guesses incorrectly, use an if statement to give them hints on how close they are

*****Homework
using the above design pattern to keep our console applicaitons open, comb through our previous projects
and implement a similar design

*****VS Tip
while tab tab and do tab tab will quickly generate wiles or do whiles for us
