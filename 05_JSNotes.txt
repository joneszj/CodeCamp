*****Setup
create another console application: 05_JSDataTypes

*****primitive types
boolean, null, undefined, number, string, symbol (ecma 6)

*****object types 
object, date, array, keyed collections (ecma 6)

*****Side
anything that is not a primitive type, is an object
With JavaScript, null is for objects, undefined is for variables, properties, and methods.

*****Assignment
create one or more variables for each primitive type
cl those variables to the console
create a js object
use the typeof method

*****Floating point quirks
0.1 + 0.2 = ??

*****Goal
Understanding the built in types for javascript
using the typeof method
potential pitfalls of floating numbers
