*****Setup
create another console application: 05_JSComments

Comments are useful!!!! Don't leave your fellow devs in the dark!

VS will include comments above functions to provide a tooltip when calling functions

Also, keep in mind that JS source is sent to client browsers, meaning users can view your comments as well
don't leave sensitive information in comments!!

//this is a single line comment

//username: zachary-jones pass: SENSITIVEINFORMATION (don't do this obviously :p)
/*
 * this
 * is
 * a
 * multiline
 * comment
 * */
