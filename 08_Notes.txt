For loops are everywhere!
*****Setup
Create a new console application: 08_ForLoopyLoops

*****For
initializes a variable, compares that variable, runs the code in the block, 
and then increments (or decrements the initial variable) and repeats until the comparison equates to true
for ({initial variable} = 0, {comparison}, {iteration}) { }
this sounds more complicate than it actually is
loops by default will start at 0, use a greater than comparison, and increment up once

*****Assignment
create a for loop, > 10
cw each iteration and include the iteration value in the cw

use the random class again to create a random number, 
and the for loop to iterate x times where x is the random number while the iteration is not equal to x
for each iteration, print something AND have a nested for loop that also prints something
(perhaps have the nest for loop print its iteration variable value)

for tab tab will quickly generate a for loop for us
