*****Setup
Create a console application: 10_JSIfElseSwitchComparisonLogicalOperators

*****If Else
if else statments allow us to execute code depending on if the if else condition returns true, or false
we can use expressions or variables for if else statement condistions
if else statements are also called conditional statments

*****Comparison Operators
== ! != > < >= <=
using an equality operator will return a boolean between two or more operands

*****Logical Operators
& && | ||
and SC-and or SC-or

*****else if
we can list if statements (similar to a switch) and each will execute if their respective conditions are met
often times this is not desireable. We can use else if statements. Else if statments will only execute if the original
if statement fails, and once the if else statement executes, no other if statements will execute

*****Assignment - Scenario: age requirement for drivers license
use conditional statements inconjunction with equality comparisons
prompt the user for a value, compare it, do something from the comparison
mix in tryparse

*****Switch
switches are useful for multiple choice selections
if else are just as capable but switches can be more easily read at times

*****Assignment - Elementary Math Quiz
Finally, we can move on to really start implementing what we have gone through
From here on out, we will be utilizing Nodes Readline class, it allows us to get a response from the user
Create a simple elementary math quiz
if the user submits a correct answer, respond congradulating them
if the user submits an incorrect answer, respont that the answer is incorrect
5-10 questions is sufficient
Use each of the equality operators

*****Assignment: Scenario: favorite color
prompt the user for their favorite color
use a switch statement to return a message

*****Goal
Be able to recognize various math and assignment operators
